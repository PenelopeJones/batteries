olefile.py is a (short lived) fork from this project.

http://www.decalage.info/python/olefileio

PyExpLabSys needed more changes to the core library, than it was
realistic to have upstreamed quickly, hence the fork. It is the goal
to upstream the changes in time. All credits for the olefile project
goes the original developers as described in the start of the
olefile.py file and on the project homepage.
